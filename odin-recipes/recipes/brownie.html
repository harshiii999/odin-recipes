    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I recently found myself in need of a good brownie recipe. My love for brownies began when I was in school
       I tried so many brownies from different shops and I tried following a few recipes myself. But not one recipe satisfied me. So I decided to make my own resipe and I finally hit that taste with one secret ingredient: Symphony bars. 
       I used the toffee-almond bars and I think that was the right idea. But, if you are baking for a picky eater or someone with allergies, 
       the smooth chocolate makes amazing brownies too.  
    </p>

    <p>Make sure to follow all the steps in great detail to get the most amazing brownies ever</p>

        <li>1-2 (7.37-ounce) Giant Symphony bars or 2-3 (4.25-ounce) XL Symphony bars, broken into squares</li>
    </ul>
